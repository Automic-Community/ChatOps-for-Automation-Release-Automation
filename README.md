<p>Built on Hubot, this ChatOps community project enables you to interact with Automic Release Automation using your favorite chat client.</p>
<p>ChatOps is a somewhat new approach to communication that allows teams to collaborate and manage not only aspects of their infrastructure and code, but a wide variety of functions within an organization, all from the comfort and safety of a chat room.</p>
<p>By automating tasks and actions so that a chatbot can execute them on your behalf, ChatOps allows you to create efficiencies in many areas of an organization, freeing up time and resources to tackle new challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, by automating tasks that can be triggered safely from a bot within a chat room, bottlenecks are removed where previously only a limited subset of people had the knowledge or access to expertly manage infrastructure, code, and information.</p>
<p>Provides following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>List Apps, Workflows, Environments, Packages, General Workflows</li>
<li>Create new Package and instrument its properties</li>
<li>Run Deployments</li>
<li>Start General Workflows</li>
<li>Management of approvals</li>
</ul>
